# US Regional Sales Data Analysis
This data analysis project is based on the dataset of a sales company having stores across the US with 5 warehouses. The dataset was obtained from ***Kaggle*** in ***.csv*** file. The dataset consists of **7991** sales records spanning over a period **from May 2018 to December 2020**. 

Before diving into the analysis of the data, dataset was cleaned by checking for any duplicate records and blank cells, proper datatype was set for each column & appropriate changes were made to the datetime columns.

In this project, key points like performance of warehouses, performance of sales teams, performance of stores & most selling products have been analysed. Seasonality in orders & sales has also been analysed for the given period of time. In this project, a key model which is widely used for customer segmentation has also been used which is known as **RFM** or **Recency Frequency Monetary** model has been used to identify the most valuable customers and customers which the company needs to focus on.

A report has also been attached to this project which summarises the key insights and also holds the conclusion of the analysis at the end. This report also holds few reccomendation at the end on how the company can improve the performance of stores, warehouses, sales teams & how they can increase sales.
